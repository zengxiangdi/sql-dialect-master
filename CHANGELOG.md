# Changelog

All notable changes to SQL Dialect Master are documented here.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- 12×12 SQL dialect conversion coverage matrix with target-dialect validation.
- Semantic regression coverage for NL2SQL and cross-dialect conversion.
- Deterministic rule ordering, selector normalization, pattern validation, and conflict detection.
- Statement-level security validation for stacked SQL statements.
- Rule-aware transpilation caching, async batch conversion, and benchmark coverage.
- Stable machine-readable `error_code` values across core transpiler and API responses.
- Runtime validation for packaged function/type JSON configuration.
- Wheel/package-data validation and installed-wheel smoke testing in CI.
- Python 3.11/3.12 CI coverage with compile and distribution checks.

### Fixed

- Cache LRU updates no longer evict unrelated entries when replacing an existing key.
- Cached `None` values are distinguished from cache misses.
- Explicitly supplied cache instances are preserved by `CachedFunction`.
- Rule dialect selectors now ignore surrounding whitespace and case.
- CI actions were upgraded to current major versions (`checkout@v5`, `setup-python@v6`).
- Cache configuration now requires a positive `cache_max_size`.

### Compatibility

- The default `security_block_dangerous` setting remains disabled for backward compatibility.
- API error responses retain existing HTTP status behavior while exposing the stable `error_code` field.
